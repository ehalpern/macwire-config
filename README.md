##MacWire Config

Declarative configuration injection using [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) with [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire).

The key benefit of dependency injection (DI) is that it removes initialization logic from your code. Instead of initializing dependencies in the constructor, you simply declare them as parameters and leave it to the DI system to call the constructor with the right values.  This leaves you with simpler classes that can be easily unit tested (and easily reconfigured). 

DI examples often focus on object dependencies.  The standard example replaces a real service with a mock service for unit testing.  However, objects also depend on configuration constants.  If the DI system doesn't inject these, then you're stuck writing code in the class to read and initialize these values.  The result is more boilerplate and dependencies on the configuration system sprinkled throughout the code.

Why not let the DI system manage configuration values as well?  This libary extends the MacWire DI system to do just that.  It uses the TypeSafe Config library as a starting point for defining and obtaining configuration.  It then provides a scala annotation macro that generates the code required to inject configuration values by name in a type safe manner. 

So given a configuration definition like

```
search {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9200
}
```

you can inject the configuration values like so:

```
class SearchService(
  host: String @@ `search.host`,  // injected with "localhost"
  port: Int @@ `search.port`      // injected with 8091
) {
  ...
}
```
###Complete  Example
##### Define the configuration
```
search {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9200
}
```
Define a standard Typesafe configuration (in resources/application.conf for example).  

##### Add the configuration to the compiler classpath in build.sbt
```
unmanagedClasspath in Compile += sourceDirectory.value / "main" / "resources"
```
The code generator determines the configuration property names and types at compile time by reading the Typesafe configuration.  To do this, it must be able to load the configuration file from the compiler classpath.  If the configuration file is in the `resources` directory, you must explicitly add that directory to the compiler classpath.   

##### Create a Config wiring object
```
import macwire.config.ConfigWiringGenerator

@ConfigWiringGenerator object Config
```
The Config object will be populated with the configuration tags and wiring required for injection.

##### Create the main wiring module
```
import com.softwaremill.macwire._

trait MainModule extends Macwire with ConfigWiring.Wiring {
  lazy val searchService = wire[SearchService]
}
```
Mix Config.Wiring into the main wiring definition to make configuration values available for injection.

##### Define the service
```
import com.softwaremill.macwire.Tagging._
import Config.Tags._

class SearchService(
  host: String @@ `search.host`,
  port: Int @@ `search.port`
) {
  def search(query: String) = {
    ...
  }
}

```
Inject configuration values into the service by declaring them in the constructor and tagging them with the 
approprate tag (generated in Config.Tags).

### Matching Rules

When declaring configuration parameter, be sure to declare the correct type and append the correct tag.  In the example above

```
  port: Int @@ `search.port`
```
The type of each config property is inferred from the property value as follows:

 Value Example | Scala type 
---------------|------------
"something" \| something | String     
true \| false  | Boolean    
5              | Int        
5.3            | Double     
["foo", "bar"] \| [foo, bar] | Seq[String]
[true, false]  | Seq[Boolean]
[1, 2, 3]      | Seq[Int]
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3] | Seq[Double]
